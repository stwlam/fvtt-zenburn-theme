# Zenburn Editor Theme

This module for [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/) provides a code editor syntax highlight theme
inspired by the famous [color scheme for Vim](https://kippura.org/zenburnpage/). The particular flavor is drawn
from the [port for Emacs](https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs) and shares its GPL-3.0 license. It is a
somewhat dark, low-contrast theme.
